# M2_EmbSys

In this project we will build a motion sensor light circuit with an arduino. A motion sensor light circuit is a circuit in which a light turns on when motion is detected. With a motion sensor integrated with an arduino, we can detect movement and program the arduino to turn a light on for a certain period of time once this motion is detected.
