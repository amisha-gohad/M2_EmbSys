# Motion Activated Light With Arduino and HC-SR04 Sensor

# Abstract
In this project we will build a motion sensor light circuit with an arduino. A motion sensor light circuit is a circuit in which a light turns on when motion is detected.
With a motion sensor integrated with an arduino, we can detect movement and program the arduino to turn a light on for a certain period of time once this motion is detected.

# Requirements

  ## High level requirements
  |  ID|Description|Status|
  |---|---|---|
  | HR01 | Ablity to Turn the light on and off. | Implemented |
  | HR02 | Ablity to Sense the motion and register it | Implemented |
  | HR03 | Ablitiy to keep a record of number of people visting the room  | Future | 
  | HR04 | Ablity to measure the darkness| Future |
  

  ## Low level requirements
  |  ID|Description|Status|
  |---|---|---|
  | LR01 | Toggle the switch | Implemented |
  | LR02 | Sense the physical motion | Impemented|
  | LR03 | Have a second sensor sensing people leaving the room and turn of the light accordingly | Future|
  
  # SWOT Analysis
  
  ## Strengths
  
  * Makes things easier for people.
  * Helps you to automate your light connections.
  * Makes your home a smart home.
  * Helps with utility costs.
  * Better for environment.
  
  ## Weakness
  * It is much expensive than normal light system.
 
 ## Opportunities
 
* We can make this accurate and more sensitive.
 
 ## Threats 
 
* Risk of theft of the light system is higher since they are non-wired.
