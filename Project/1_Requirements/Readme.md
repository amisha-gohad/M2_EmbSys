# Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>

## Introduction
In this project we will build a motion sensor light circuit with an arduino. A motion sensor light circuit is a circuit in which a light turns on when motion is detected. With a motion sensor integrated with an arduino, we can detect movement and program the arduino to turn a light on for a certain period of time once this motion is detected.

  ## High Level Requirements
  |  ID|Description|Status|
  |---|---|---|
  | HLR01 | It shall turn the light on and off. | To be done |
  | HLR02 | It shall sense the motion and register it | To be done |
  | HLR03 | It shall keep a record of number of people visting the room  | Future | 
  | HLR04 |  It shall measure the darkness| Future |
  

  ## Low Level Requirements
  |  ID|Description|Status|
  |---|---|---|
  | LLR01 | Toggle the switch | To be done |
  | LLR02 | Sense the physical motion | To be done |
  | LLR03 | Have a second sensor sensing people leaving the room and turn of the light accordingly | Future|

   # SWOT Analysis <a name="swot"></a>
  
  ## Strengths
  
  * Makes things easier for people.
  * Helps you to automate your light connections.
  * Makes your home a smart home.
  * Helps with utility costs.
  * Better for environment.
  
  ## Weakness
  * It is much expensive than normal light system.
 
 ## Opportunities
 
* We can make this accurate and more sensitive.
 
 ## Threats 
 
* Risk of theft of the light system is higher since they are non-wired.
